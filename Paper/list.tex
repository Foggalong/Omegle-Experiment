\noindent{\Huge\bf Omegle Automated Social Experiment}
\bigskip

This is a proof of concept program, aiming to demonstrate the possibility of using Omegle, (a free
anonymous, online chat site) as a source of subjects for simple automated social experiments. The
experiment I will be using in this POC is very simple, and can be reproduced extremely easy.

\indent{\it \bf{Name}: 1 to 100}
\indent{\it \bf{Task}: 5 seconds to pick a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive)}
\indent{\it \bf{Query}: does the phrasing of the interval and an effect on the numbers chosen?}
