# Omegle Experiment
This is a proof of concept repo, aiming to demonstrate the possibility of using [Omegle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omegle) (a free, anonymous, online chat site) as a source of subjects for simple social experiments. The experiment used in this POC is very simple:

    Name: One and 100
    Task: 5 seconds to pick a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
    Query: does the phrasing of the interval have an effect on the numbers chosen?

In carrying out this experiment and answering the above question I will utilise various different programming languages. As such, this repo is split into three parts, each under a different license.

### Analysis
Programmed in R, this is where I do analysis on the results generated. Licensed under the GNU GPLv3+.

### Bot
This is bot and module which will communicate with the Omegle users. It is written in Python and based on an older module called [py-omegle](https://code.google.com/p/py-omegle/). As such, this is licensed under the MIT license.

### Paper
I have written up my findings in the markup language LaTeX. This license for this part of the project is still undecided.
